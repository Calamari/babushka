A lot of the tech jobs we do manually aren't challenging or fun, but they're quite particular and have to be done just right -- they're chores. Things that are important to do, but that are better automated than done manually.

That's what babushka is for. Once you describe a job using its DSL, babushka can not only accomplish each part of the job, but also check if each part is already satisfied. For each component of the job, a test, along with the code to make that test pass -- test-driven sysadmin.


### Installing

Babushka is most easily installed using `babushka.me/up`, a shell script that installs babushka via git (and its dependencies, ruby and git, via your system's package manager if required). It's safe to run on existing systems, and intended to be used as the first shell command on a new system too. You can install babushka this way using `curl` or `wget`:

    sh -c "`curl https://babushka.me/up`"

If you'd rather install manually, all you need to do is clone [the git repo](https://github.com/benhoskings/babushka)Â (or extract an archive of it), and if you like, link `bin/babushka.rb` into your path as 'babushka'.

Check [the install documentation](http://babushka.me/installing), for the full details on customising the installation, including locking to specific versions and installing from forks using `babushka.me/up`.


### Supported systems

Babushka itself should run on any Unix; there's nothing in the core of babushka that requires anything other than unix, ruby, and git.

I develop babushka against OS X and Ubuntu, so homebrew and apt are the best-supported package managers. There is also some yum (RedHat/Fedora/CentOS) and pacman (Arch) support, thanks to others' contributions. On other systems, specific operations (like installing a package using that system's package manager) will fail with an error message, but otherwise babushka should run fine. In any case, patches are most welcome.
